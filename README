How to read the HELP document
========================================================================
The HELP document is written in reStructuredText (rst). Although
reStructuredText is an easy-to-read plain text markup format, it is
recommended to convert it to HTML for a better reading experience.

In order to convert this document to HTML you need `docutils`, which
you can install in your system using `pip`::

    pip install docutils

Or `easy_install`:

    easy_install docutils

Once `docutils` is installed, you can use the `rst2html.py` utility to
perform the conversion:

    rst2html.py HELP help.html

Then use any web browser to view the exported `help.html` file.
